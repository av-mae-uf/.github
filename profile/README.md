# EML4930: Autonomous Vehicles at UF-MAE

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/av1tenth-docs/badge/?version=latest)](https://av1tenth-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

This organization will be a common area to store all class skeleton codes, assignments and documentation. Visible repositories should be the ReadTheDocs repo, which can be accessed online at [AV1Tenth Docs](https://av1tenth-docs.readthedocs.io). All PDF documentation for assignments will be available in the assignments repo. 

## Requirements

To be successful in this class you will need a basic understanding of Python and programming in general. Resources will be availed below.

### Hardware Requirements
You will need some sort of computer that can run Ubuntu 20.04 (preferred), or a Debian equivalent of the Focal release (If installing through Debian packages, Debian Buster 10 will also work if built from source). A minimum requirement sheet is given below. 

- 2 GHz dual-core processor
- 4 GiB RAM
- 50 GB disk space
- Display compatible (HDMI/VGA/DVI etc.)
- USB Port
- Internet Access

These are the minimum requirements for Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa. If you're looking for used computer check out the [UF Surplus website](https://surplus.ufl.edu/buy-now/). These can be run on VM's but some software will have issues with our simulation package Gazebo, we recommend having a dual-boot or dedicated computer that can run Ubuntu 20.04.

### Software Requirements
You will need some software to be successful in this class, all are listed below:

- [Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/) (Or Equivalent)
- [ROS2 Foxy](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/index.html)
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Gazebo](https://gazebosim.org/home)

The following are optional software packages that we find helpful during development:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com) (A useful tool for collaboration and to get code onto the vehicle)
- [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) (An alternative to GitHub)

If you need help installing anything talk to the TA's for this class. There is also a bootable drive with Ubuntu 20.04 available in the CIMAR Lab

## Learning Resources

There are numerous resources to choose from when learning ROS2 or Python, some are given below:

- [ROS2 Tutorials](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials.html)
- [Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)
- [C++](https://www.w3schools.com/CPP/default.asp) (This is completely optional, but ROS2 does allow coding in C++)

ROS2 will be covered extensively during lecture, but Python will not be. Some information and learning on python will be done during lecture, but this will mainly pertain to usefulness in ROS2. C++ will not be covered in this class at all, but again it can be used in ROS2 and it often is. We are using python for simplicity and development purposes. All assignments will be expected in Python for ease of grading.

Our [ReadTheDocs](https://av1tenth-docs.readthedocs.io) will cover many things about physical hardware and software packages that will be given to you. This will range from communication with the controllers, sensors etc., and will have information about building the entire system as well. Sensor information will be given in detail and will be useful in understanding of sensor data will be given to the computer to be processed by your code.
